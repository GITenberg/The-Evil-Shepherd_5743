description: Francis Ledsam, alert, well-satisfied with himself and the world, the
  echo of a little buzz of congratulations still in his ears, paused on the steps
  of the modern Temple of Justice to light a cigarette before calling for a taxi to
  take him to his club. Visions of a whisky and soda, his throat was a little parched
  and a rubber of easy-going bridge at his favourite table, were already before his
  eyes.
